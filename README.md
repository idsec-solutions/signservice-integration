The [Swedish eID Framework](https://docs.swedenconnect.se/technical-framework/) defines a model for Federated Central Signing Services. The **signservice-integration** repository contains a number of open source components for integrating with a Signature Service according to the specifications of the Swedish eID Framework.

The **signservice-integration** repository comprises of:

* A definition of a Signature Service Integration API.

* An implementation of the Signature Service Integration API.

* Modules for handling different signature formats (XML, PDF, CMS).

* A definition of a RESTful API for creating a Signature Service Integration REST application.

* A sample Spring Boot application that implements a Signature Service Integration REST application.

See <https://idsec-solutions.github.io/signservice-integration/> for documentation of how to use the API.
